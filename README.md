Basics:
User has Fields.
    Fields are importand life affairs.
Fields consist of Habits.
    Habits are actions that the user wishes to track. They are related to the user's Field(s).
Habit has a Specification.
    Reuse habit name/type with a spec for idk why.

User can rate the state of the field through his subjective mind, of how he perceives the situation at some point in time. Basically how he is doing.
User may set up Reminders for the Habits he has set up, in order to improve in the Field and general.
With the info from Habits, Doti is able to scetch up a day/week/month/year plan.
